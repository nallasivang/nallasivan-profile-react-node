## Message to the world
 
* Never under/over estimate any one. Each and every human being has the same amount of Talent as you have, the amount of effort towards may differ and that makes you feel like a legend, but you will be ashamed if the other started to push more efforts.  

* You will be judged by GOD as per your attitude towards the people. GOD treats all equal and there is not even a fraction of extra love towards anyone irrespective of how you pray and other never pray in the entire life

* GOD always treats us as his own child. There is no biased. 

* A person who do the job of cleaning the toilet (always equal to) A person who owns huge money. Never treat people based on their color, job, money. If you do then you opened your door towards the sin and you will get returns with interest without any doubt. 

* LOVE PEOPLE, LOVE GOD, LOVE ALL

### LOVE YOU, NALLASIVAN G
